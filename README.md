# OWS Turn Assistant

A small static HTML/CSS/JS helper that walks players through the **Operational Wargame System (OWS)** turn sequence, with a built-in dice roller and per-step local reminders.

## Run locally

- Open `index.html` in your browser (recommended).
- Or serve the folder with any static server and browse to the root.

## Notes

- Reminders are stored in `localStorage` (device/browser specific).
- If you previously used `index.html.html`, it’s still present, but `index.html` is the standard entry point most hosts expect.
